## Description

The Volume Mag Forex Trading Robot is designed to generate trading signals based on specific conditions. It uses the Trade library for executing trades on the MetaTrader platform.

## How It Works

The code is structured as follows:

1. Include the required Trade library.
2. Define necessary variables: `signalCount` to keep track of the number of signals generated and `signalGenerated` to track if a signal has already been generated.
3. Initialize the Trade object.
4. Implement the `GenerateSignals()` function to generate trading signals based on specific conditions. The signals should be generated selectively to avoid information overload.
5. Implement the `EvaluateSignals()` function to evaluate the signals after the close of the current candle. This ensures that signals are not redrawn or lagged.
6. In the `OnStart()` function, generate trading signals using `GenerateSignals()` and evaluate the signals using `EvaluateSignals()`.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the necessary Trade library is included in your MetaTrader platform.
2. Copy and paste the code into a new Expert Advisor in MetaEditor.
3. Customize the `GenerateSignals()` function to implement your own trading strategy.
4. Compile the Expert Advisor.
5. Attach the Expert Advisor to a chart in MetaTrader.
6. The Expert Advisor will generate trading signals based on your strategy and evaluate them after the close of each candle.
